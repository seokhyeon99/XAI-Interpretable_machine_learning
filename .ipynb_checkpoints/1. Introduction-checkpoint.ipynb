    "## What Is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- Machine learning is a method for teaching computers to make and improve predictions or behaviors based on data.\n",
    "- The book focuses on supervised machine learning, which includes all problems where we know the label or the outcome of interest and want to learn to predict.\n",
    "- The goal in supervised learning is to learn a predictive model that maps features to an output.\n",
    "- Machine learning tasks are different, but the approach is the same:\n",
    "   \tStep 1: Collect data. The more, the better.\n",
    "   \tStep 2: Feed this information into a machine learning algrotihm.\n",
    "       Step 3: Integrate the model into the product or process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Advantages: speed, reproducibility, and scale.\n",
    "    - Disadvantages: hidden insights within complex model.    "
